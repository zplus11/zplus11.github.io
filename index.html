					<p>I am a post-graduate student of Mathematics at the University of Delhi, having done my bachelors in the same subject from the same university. Apart from Mathematics, I am interested in many other things including design, typesetting, music and photography.</p>
					<p>
					<strong>Projects.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The things I have worked on can be found <a href="https://github.com/zplus11" target="_blank">here.</a>
					</p>
					<p>
					<strong>Highlights.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;I contributed as head of the student organising team and as student coordinator to ICMSA 2024 organised by Department of Mathematics, Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur Khalsa College, University of Delhi. Over 140 delegates joined the 3-day international conference. Apart from that, I also served as a student editor of the college's official magazine <a href="https://sgtbkhalsadu.ac.in/studentscorner/magazines" target="_blank">Tegh</a> during 2023&ndash;25 and my department's magazine <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1U3yBc7gK5sYMe6DK4fy1xJwuG9d3Vf1M/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Mathos</a> in 2024&ndash;25.
					</p>
					<p>
					I have joined numerous workshops including 2 national ones on topics varying from numerical optimisation to programming with Python. I have also delivered two presentations on <a href="https://resources.wolframcloud.com/PacletRepository/resources/Taggar/MGroups" target="_blank">MGroups,</a> a Mathematica package I developed, on two different occassions &mdash; once at ICMSA 2024 and the other at a paper presentation competition held by Jesus &amp; Mary College in February, 2025 winning first prize out of 60+ abstracts and 8 shortlisted offline presentations.
					</p>
					<p>
					I have performed analysis of two data-sets: both of the works are available <a href="https://rpubs.com/taggar" target="_blank">here.</a> I also talk about my contributions to Wolfram's public repositories <a href="pages/posts/Wolfram.html">here.</a>
					<p>
					<p>	<strong>Skills &amp; Languages.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; I speak English and Hindi. I know Mathematica (upto proficiency), Python, R, and a little bit of Javascript. I am well-experienced with LaTeX, and familiar with Inkscape (vector graphics editing), HTML, CSS, and Markdown.
